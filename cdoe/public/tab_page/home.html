<h5>The objective of the team is to build an online thrift store which can attract customers to sell/buy
    stuffs, especially clothes, shoes, and bags. Recycling your stuffs will keep them out of the trash and
    into the hands of someone who can give them a second life. And it would contribute to environment benefits.

<h5>Each year, American threw 13 million tons of clothing away and most of them are being trashed. Most of
    the clothes should be recycled. Currently, there are no online thrift store focus on clothing on the
    market. At the same time, some websites do not have proper UI design, and are not attractive to
    customers.</h5>
